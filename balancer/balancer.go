// Balancer makes sure the Server is not smashed with incoming requests (work chunks) by only enabling certain number
// of parallel requests processed by the Server. Imagine there's a SLO defined, and we don't want to make the expensive
// service people angry.
//
// If implementing more advanced balancer, ake sure to correctly assign processing capacity to a client based on other
// clients currently in process.
// To give an example of this, imagine there's a maximum number of work chunks set to 100 and there are two clients
// registered, both with the same priority. When they are both served in parallel, each of them gets to send
// 50 chunks at the same time.
// In the same scenario, if there were two clients with priority 1 and one client with priority 2, the first
// two would be allowed to send 25 requests and the other one would send 50. It's likely that the one sending 50 would
// be served faster, finishing the work early, meaning that it would no longer be necessary that those first two
// clients only send 25 each but can and should use the remaining capacity and send 50 again.
